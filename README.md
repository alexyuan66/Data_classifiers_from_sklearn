# Data_classification_code_with_sklearn

These are the python programs to practice using data classification algorithms provided in the scikit-learn (sklearn) package.
These programs analyze the dataset iris.dat and predict the type of iris for each flowers based on four parameters: sepal_len, sepal_wid, petal_len
and petal_wid. The program then outputs the accuracy of the classifiers on the testing data.  

The same classifiers to process the voice data from Parkinson's patients and got reasonably good results.
