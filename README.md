# Data_classification_code_with_sklearn

These are the python programs I developed for practicing data classification algorithms provided in the scikit-learn (sklearn) package.
These programs analyze the dataset iris.data and predict the type of iris flower based on four parameters: sepal_len, sepal_wid, petal_len
and petal_wid. The program then outputs the accuracy of the classifiers on the testing data.  

The same classifiers were used to process the voice data from Parkinson's patients and produced reasonably good results.
